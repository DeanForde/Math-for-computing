# C-sharp-Maths-for-computing-project-RSA-encrypt-decrypt-
Math project for college, allowing me to demonstrate my understanding of various mathematical problems as well my coding knowledge

This project contains the following coding solutions to these various math problems:

- sum the multiples of 3 and 5
- prime factorisation
- even fibonacci numbers below certain limit
- extended euclidian algorithms
- RSA encrypt 
- RSA decrypt

NOTES:

- I WOULD NEVER USE MY 'RSA SOLUTION' IN A REAL WORLD SITUATIONS AS IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO EXPLOITATION SUCH AS TIMING ATTACKS AND SO FORTH. 

- I AM AWARE OF THE 'MODPOW' FUNCTION IN C SHARP BUT WAS SPECIFIED NOT TO USE IT

- I AM AWARE OF THE CRYPTO LIBS IN C SHARP BUT WAS SPECIFIED TO CREATE MY OWN SOLUTION

- THERE WAS A FAR SUPERIOR/PROPERLY EXPLAINED/ WELL DOCUMENTED READ ME FILE BUT I HAVE MISPLACED IT AND GIVEN THE TIME I WILL CORRECT THIS ONE AS TO WHAT A PERSON SHOULD EXPECT FROM A GOOD READ ME FILE

- THIS WAS JUST A BASIC PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE MY UNDERSTANDING OF SOME MATH PROBLEMS AND IS NOT HOW I WOULD CODE CETAIN PROJECTS IN THE REAL WORLD
